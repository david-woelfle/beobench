Environments
============

Beobench provides easy access to a large number of building control environments for reinforcement learning. Each environment comes from one of the integrated frameworks `BOPTEST <https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest>`_, `Energym <https://github.com/bsl546/energym>`_ and `Sinergym <https://github.com/jajimer/sinergym>`_. The list below shows links to all environments available out-of-the-box. Each environment is marked based on whether it represents a residential building (|home|), office (|office|) or data center (|industry|).
