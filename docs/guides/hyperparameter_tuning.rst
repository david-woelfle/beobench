Hyperparameter Tuning
---------------------

There multiple different ways with which hyperparameters
can be tuned in experiments involving Beobench environments.
In this page we illustrate the usage of the `W&B Sweeps API
<https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps>`_ in combination with Beobench, but there
are other options as well (e.g. `Ray Tune <https://www.ray.io/ray-tune>`_).

W&B Sweeps
^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure that the W&B ``wandb`` Python package is installed. Follow the
`official quickstart <https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart>`_ if it is
not installed yet.
